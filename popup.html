            <h3>What's first party cookies?</h3>
            <p>
              First party cookies are cookies that are set by the website a user visited directly. To be specific, 
              the host name of a first party cookie is the same as the domain in the browser address bar when it is set or retrieved. If you delete the first party cookie, it can be inconvenient for both website visitors and operators because it allows the collection of usage statistics that assist in improving the online experience for visitors.
            </p>
            <h4>Primary Usage</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Automatically login.</li>
              <li>Keep track of items in online shopping carts.</li> 
              <li>Determine whether the computer has visited the website before.</li>  
              <li>Reduce the amount of time to enter and process the same information each time a website is visited.</li>

            <h3>What's third party cookies?</h3>
            <p>
              Third party cookies are a cookies set up on the visitor hard drive by a domain or website distinct from the visited one. Third party cookies are implemented by marketing vendors and partners of the visited website by the way of third party tags.

              For example, if you visit a site that has a YouTube video in one of its pages. This has been included by the website owner, using a piece of code provided by YouTube. YouTube will then be able to set cookies through this code, and know that you have watched that video, or even just visited the page the video is in.

            </p>
            <h4>Primary Usage</h4>
